### VIRTUA-PET

This is a simple project that will create a virtual pet that you will have to feed, keep fit, and look after for as long as you can! Think Tamagotchi, but in CLI...

### FEATURES

- Create new pets with "const examplePet = new Pet('theirName');"
- Check on your pet's hunger and fitness with "examplePet.checkUp();"
- Feed your pet with "examplePet.feed();"
- Take your pet for a walk and keep it fit and active with "examplePet.walk();"
- ** NEW ** Allow one pet to adopt another that you have created! "examplePet.adoptChild(itsChildsName);"

### HOW LONG CAN YOU KEEP YOUR VIRTUA-PETS ALIVE?
